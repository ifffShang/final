## What were some challenges you faced while making this app?
Hui: It's so hard to find bugs to check whether jwt token has been used. Navigation bar is hard to design since I have to switch it from logging in or logging out.

## Given more time, what additional features, functional or design changes would you make
Hui: Edit the setting page to ensure users to update their avatars, bios and usernames.

## What assumptions did you make while working on this assignment?
Hui: I assumed the users would want an intuitive and responsive interface for updating their profile details. Based on this, I designed the settings page to prioritize simplicity, ensuring the fields for usernames, bios, and avatars were easy to find. Additionally, I assumed that the backend APIs would follow REST conventions and that the user authentication mechanism was already in place, which allowed me to focus more on the frontend functionality.

## How long did this assignment take to complete?
Hui: The assignment took me over 5 days to complete.
